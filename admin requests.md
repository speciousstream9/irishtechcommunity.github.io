*TOS Breach* - Removal of content by @MartinZoo in #jobs

[Didn't remember to copy it]

> [WE DON'T DEAL WITH RECUITERS THANKS] <- example of the content

Was at the start of the jobs post which was a breach on...basically everything (Anti-social, discrimination, doesn't fit the format outlined etc). So it was removed. OP was contacted with time allowed to edit their post to something more appropriate, did not get a response from the OP and it was removed.

Upcoming event for female entrepreneurs!
Last edited about an hour ago
Hey guys! We design customised events around topics that matter. We want to invite you to a dinner event for women entrepreneurs on Nov 3 that we're hosting with Accenture - there will be big speakers, mentoring, funding opportunities, chats - and most importantly, really good food  And it's free! This event will be different than others because we'll be co-creating it with you - on the RSVP we ask what you want out of it so we can tailor the event to what you're looking for.
Here's the RSVP form! bit.ly/2cKVIvz 

From the following channels : #business, #food, #alcohol, #conferences, #events. 

Due to it being an event, I've left the post in #events and have contacted the OP informing her about the deletions and our guides to etiqutte and FAQ's
