Upcoming event for female entrepreneurs!
Last edited about an hour ago
Hey guys! We design customised events around topics that matter. We want to invite you to a dinner event for women entrepreneurs on Nov 3 that we're hosting with Accenture - there will be big speakers, mentoring, funding opportunities, chats - and most importantly, really good food  And it's free! This event will be different than others because we'll be co-creating it with you - on the RSVP we ask what you want out of it so we can tailor the event to what you're looking for.
Here's the RSVP form! bit.ly/2cKVIvz 

From the following channels : #business, #food, #alcohol, #conferences, #events. 

Due to it being an event, I've left the post in #events and have contacted the OP informing her about the deletions and our guides to etiqutte and FAQ's
